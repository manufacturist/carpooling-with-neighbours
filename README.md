## How it works

A neighbour offers a ride by filling out a form. Every Sunday, an email is sent after 18:00 with a list of available rides for the upcoming week to all those interested. Neighbours can also check the latest available rides on a webpage.

```
Hey Sally Carrera,

Here are the available rides for next week:

üöò California International Speedway | Wednesday, Aug 20, 13:37 PM
Driver: Lightning McQueen (+0123456789)
Meet: Mater's Garage (Radiator Springs) | Seats: 3

üöò Brunch @ Central Perk Coffeehouse | Saturday, Aug 23, 12:00 AM
Driver: Joey Tribianni (Apt. 4, +0123456789)
Meet: Downstairs | Seats: 4

If any of them work for you, just reach out to the driver to reserve a spot.

You can also offer a ride here: https://forms.gle/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ

If you'd rather not receive these updates, tell us by replying to this email, 
and we'll remove you manually.

Cheers,
The Carpooling with neighbours Team
```

To use this solution, someone in the community / neighbourhood must fulfill the role of the Admin. The Admin needs to manually add users to a spreadsheet. Only users listed in the spreadsheet can receive the Sunday email or offer rides using the form.

üí° If you don‚Äôt plan to send the Sunday email, you only need to add drivers to the spreadsheet

üí° To improve the chances of success, start with a small group of neighbours. Once you've tested it together and seen how it works, you can announce it to the community: `Hey, we are a group of X neighbours who have tried [...]`

<br/>

## Benefits

1. Zero costs! No app instalations or account registrations required (except for drivers<sup>(1)</sup>)

2. It works for any number of users<sup>(2)</sup>

3. It‚Äôs a simple way to get in touch with your neighbours and help lessen the traffic in your area

<br/>

<sup>(1)</sup> Drivers must have a verified Google account to offer rides through the form

<sup>(2)</sup> Sunday email. 100 is the daily email quota for free accounts and 1500 for workspace ones

<br/>

## Setup

To get started, you‚Äôll need to decide whether to use a personal Google account or a secondary one. Note that emails will be sent using your email address, using plus addressing (`your-email+carpooling@gmail.com`).

To install:
* The easiest way is to copy the public project from [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/home/projects/11ADPu5NSESfauVR8TfyNeUxq9aPh8acRuLuhXH-_sFCekqEsi3EzLcFg) into your account
* Alternatively, if you‚Äôre tech-savvy, you can use [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) on the downloaded project

Now, on your project page:  

1. Click the project settings icon ‚öôÔ∏è on the left side of the page and pick your time zone

2. Also on the left, click the code editor symbol `< >` and open the `src/_main.gs` file.

3. In this file, choose the language by modifying the second line of code, then save the change by clicking üíæ, or using Ctrl + S or CMD + S. Possible options are: <br/>
   `en` - English <br/>
   `ro` - Romanian

4. Run the `main` function by pressing the ‚ñ∑ button. This will create:  
   * The users file (Spreadsheet)  
   * The form for offering a ride
   * The ride offers file (Spreadsheet), where the form responses will be saved  
   * A trigger that sets the phone number in the users file when the driver adds it to the form  
   * A trigger that sends an email to recipients every Sunday, sometime between 18:00 - 19:00  

5. Now, press the big blue `Deploy` button and pick the `New deployment` option. In the new opened window, press `Deploy`. Now, you'll see the `Web App` link which can be used to access the available rides. If you can access it and see an empty list, the setup is complete

The next step is optional:

6. The default unsubscribe mode is `manual`. If you want your neighbours to be able to unsubscribe automatically, by replying with 'unsubscribe' to the received email, then:  
   * In project settings (‚öôÔ∏è), scroll to the bottom of the page and click the button to edit the script properties
   * Change the UNSUBSCRIBE_MODE property from `manual` to `auto` and save
   * Open the `src/unsubscribe.js` file and run the `activateAutomaticEmailUnsubscribeTrigger` function
   * This will activate an automatic check (every 30 minutes) for unsubscribe emails and remove subscribers from the user list

Your only remaining task is to manually populate the user list. For each interested neighbour, you‚Äôll need to add their email, desired language `[en, ro]` and `1` in the notification column if they should receive the Sunday email, otherwise leave it empty; optionally, you can also add their name, phone number, and a reference for driver identification (apartment/office). That‚Äôs it. 

Names are useful for personalizing emails and reducing the chances of them being marked as spam. Phone numbers are necessary for drivers, and the optional reference helps email recipients better understand who the driver is.  

If something breaks, good luck <3 *"The fragile digital fabric holding this solution together is torn. Destroy it and rebuild it."* Save the data from the users file, then uninstall the solution. You‚Äôll need to open the `src/uninstall.gs` file and run `‚ñ∑` the `uninstall` function. Then, restart the installation process from step 2.

## FAQ

* **Why not add a form for users to allow them to easily subscribe to the ride offers email?** <br/>
  * We vet each user individually because we handle personal data. Access must be limited to those who are part of the community

* **Why not add a form for ride reservations?**
  * We want to encourage direct social interaction between the driver and the potential rider, not limit it
  * If a form is used, the driver may need to initiate a refusal if they‚Äôre uncomfortable with the rider, but when the rider initiates contact, it allows the driver to assess, ask questions, and respond in their own way, making the process more personal and respectful
  * It complicates the UX and the code

* **What do you think about multilingual forms for drivers?**
  * This need hasn't come up yet
  * It complicates the code. It requires a spreadsheet with multiple sheets (one per form)

## Inspiration

The challenge was *"How can I create a carpooling solution that works for any community with minimal effort and zero costs?"*. I created this solution after a neighbour gave me a ride to work (thanks, Roli!). I hope it inspires you to seek simplicity. Simple is hard.
